							A healthy diet rich in fruits, vegetables, whole grains and
							low-fat dairy can help to reduce your risk of heart disease by
							maintaining blood pressure and cholesterol levels. High blood
							pressure and cholesterol can be a symptom of too much salt and
							saturated fats in your diet.
						</p>
						<p>
							Many healthful foods, including vegetables, fruits, and beans, are
							lower in calories than most processed foods.
						</p>
						<p>
							Children learn most health-related behaviors from the adults
							around them, and parents who model healthful eating and exercise
							habits tend to pass these on.
